Actually test VMSVCCHECK (checking of some services inside a VM from
host via custom hook scripts).

Add setting of host timezone not equal to user/OS default timezone,
i.e. run VMs as UTC whatever the user's own preference is.

Allow to set CPU Affinity in some manner...

Change PKG paths to /opt/VirtualBox/vboxsvc (for sparse-root zones)?
