Actually test VMSVCCHECK (checking of some services inside a VM from
host via custom hook scripts) - done for SSH banner checks.

TEST setting of host timezone not equal to user/OS default timezone,
i.e. run VMs as UTC whatever the user's own preference is.

TEST zfs snapshots in various combinations (dataset names and pathnames,
set in variables for instance and service levels, mix with auto);
currently tested only as autodetected pathnames for local and NFS-backed
ZFS datasets (individual per-VM), for root-owned and user-owned VMs.

Allow to set CPU Affinity in some manner...

Change PKG paths to /opt/VirtualBox/vboxsvc (for sparse-root zones)?
May be useless since one common kernel-side part of VirtualBox is
installed and runs in global zone anyway.
